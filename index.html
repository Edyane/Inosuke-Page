                        A young boy who was raised by his mother Kotoha Hashibira for a short time until
                        she was murdered by the Upper Moon Two, Doma. After she sacrificed herself to save
                        his life, he was raised by wild boars, and then taught to read and write by an old
                        man. Inosuke Hashibira uses a self-taught style called 
                        "Beast Breathing" (獣の呼吸, Kedamono no kokyū), along with two serrated swords in
                        battle.                                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When he gets new swords, he purposely makes them serrated in order to match his
                        preference and fighting style (much to the swordsmith's anger). He is brash and prone
                        to reacting violently, and while he appears dim, he has proven himself in battle time
                        after time.
